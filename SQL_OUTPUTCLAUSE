It returns a copy of data that you have inserted into or deleted from your tables

 You can return that data to a table variable, 
 a temporary or permanent table, or to the processing application 
 thatâ€™s calls the DML statement. You can then use that data for such purposes as archiving, 
 confirmation messaging, or other application requirements.
